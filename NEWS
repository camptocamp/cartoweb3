=============

2012-05-10: CartoWeb 3.6.0
==========================

- Support of Mapserver/Mapscript >= 6.0.2 & PhP >= 5.3.8 
  !!! WARNING : Compatibility BREAK !!!
  !!! Projects developped with cw3.6 are not backward compatible with cw3.5 !!!
  cw3setup.php will check basically if you have supported version or more recent

- MAPSERVER 6x  
	* Transparency/opacity : 
		Take care to cleanup your map of the deprecaded TRANSPARENCY keywords for LAYERS & Scalebar
		To migrate your old transparency effect use the inverse for opacity : transparency 30 = opacity 70
		Scalebar : have a look at comment in demoCW3.map.in to learn about the details.
	* OUTPUTFORMAT : carefully read the instruction on mapserver doc to knows how to migrate to default agg/png etc
		New examples have been pushed in demoCW3.map.in
	* QUERY by point on a polygon (at least for wfs) need to have a not null tolerance declared
		TOLERANCE 0.0001
		TOLERANCEUNITS pixels	  
		seems to be a bug in mapserver6

- CARTOWEB 3.6
	* .ini need to be fixed like for the 3.5.5 level (see below)
	* QUERY : query now initialize all query with mayFail = true, mapserver now respect what is documented
		querybyAttribute and querybyid return only elements that intersect the viewed box. This drive to a new comportment
		if you query for example in demoCW3 a montain, then pan the map until this montain is no more visible on the map
		the next query on a new montain, will delete the previous result and not keep it like previously.
	* Surcharging :
		If you have surcharged or extented any part of CW3, take time to review any of them against the trunk, and
		backport your surcharge against the new code.
	* XSS vulnerability :
		Some XSS attack could be driven by XSS injection on previous code. PHP_SELF usage was removed and satanized by using
		SCRIPT_NAME 
	* Installation or upgrade : no new dependencies are needed compared to 3.5.5 (see below)

2012-04-01: CartoWeb 3.5.5
==========================

- Fix compatibility with now PhP 5.3.x and mapserver 5.6x (old versions aren't supported)
- PhP 5.3 impose a massive rework of all .ini files used the format is key = "value" except for boolean true/false
	you could use the ./scripts/patch_php53_ini.sh script to help you to adjust all values
- include : need to be refresh with the new libs.tar.gz (cw3setup.php will take care of that with version 3.5.5)
- include : all pear packages have been removed from include, manage them system wide, or locally check the list in ./scripts/pear_list
	@todo : Log4php : now version 2.2.1 http://logging.apache.org/log4php/download.html
	our 0.9x
	Installation could be done as a pear package too
	pear channel-discover pear.apache.org/log4php
	pear install log4php/Apache_log4php
- Projects : 
	* demoCW3 is fully functionnal, and has wfs client layers (queryable)
	* demoEdit, test_main has been fixed
	* demoTools has its .ini fixed for php5.3
	* Others are in the old state and need to be checked/fixed
